Euler's Totient function, &#966;(n) [sometimes called the phi function], is used to determine the number of positive numbers less than or equal to n which are relatively prime to n. For example, as 1, 2, 4, 5, 7, and 8, are all less than nine and relatively prime to nine, &#966;(9)=6.The number 1 is considered to be relatively prime to every positive number, so &#966;(1)=1. 
Interestingly, &#966;(87109)=79180, and it can be seen that 87109 is a permutation of 79180.
Find the value of n, 1 < n < 107, for which &#966;(n) is a permutation of n and the ratio n/&#966;(n) produces a minimum.
