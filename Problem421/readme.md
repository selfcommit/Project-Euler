
Numbers of the form n15+1 are composite for every integer n > 1.
For positive integers n and m let s(n,m) be defined as the sum of the distinct prime factors of n15+1 not exceeding m.

E.g. 215+1 = 3&#215;3&#215;11&#215;331.
So s(2,10) = 3 and s(2,1000) = 3+11+331 = 345.

Also 1015+1 = 7&#215;11&#215;13&#215;211&#215;241&#215;2161&#215;9091.
So s(10,100) = 31 and s(10,1000) = 483.
