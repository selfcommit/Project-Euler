
Consider the real number &#8730;2+&#8730;3.
When we calculate the even powers of &#8730;2+&#8730;3
we get:
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)2 = 9.898979485566356...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)4 = 97.98979485566356...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)6 = 969.998969071069263...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)8 = 9601.99989585502907...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)10 = 95049.999989479221...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)12 = 940897.9999989371855...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)14 = 9313929.99999989263...
(&#8730;2+&#8730;3)16 = 92198401.99999998915...


It looks like that the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of these powers is non-decreasing.
In fact it can be proven that the fractional part of (&#8730;2+&#8730;3)2n approaches 1 for large n.


Consider all real numbers of the form &#8730;p+&#8730;q with p and q positive integers and p<q, such that the fractional part 
of (&#8730;p+&#8730;q)2n approaches 1 for large n.


Let C(p,q,n) be the number of consecutive nines at the beginning of the fractional part of  (&#8730;p+&#8730;q)2n.


Let N(p,q) be the minimal value of n such that C(p,q,n) &#8805; 2011.


Find &#8721;N(p,q) for p+q &#8804; 2011.
