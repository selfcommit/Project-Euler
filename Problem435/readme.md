The Fibonacci numbers {fn, n &#8805; 0} are defined recursively as fn = fn-1 + fn-2 with base cases f0 = 0 and f1 = 1.
Define the polynomials {Fn, n &#8805; 0} as Fn(x) = &#8721;fixi for 0 &#8804; i &#8804; n.
For example, F7(x) = x + x2 + 2x3 + 3x4 + 5x5 + 8x6 + 13x7, and F7(11) = 268357683.
Let n = 1015. Find the sum [&#8721;0&#8804;x&#8804;100 Fn(x)] mod 1307674368000 (= 15!).
