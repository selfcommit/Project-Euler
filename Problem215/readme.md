Consider the problem of building a wall out of 2&#215;1 and 3&#215;1 bricks (horizontal&#215;vertical dimensions) such that, for extra strength, the gaps between horizontally-adjacent bricks never line up in consecutive layers, i.e. never form a "running crack".
For example, the following 9&#215;3 wall is not acceptable due to the running crack shown in red:



There are eight ways of forming a crack-free 9&#215;3 wall, written W(9,3) = 8.
Calculate W(32,10).
