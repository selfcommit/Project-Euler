Albert chooses a positive integer k, then two real numbers a, b are randomly chosen in the interval [0,1] with uniform distribution.
The square root of the sum (k&#183;a+1)2&#8201;+&#8201;(k&#183;b+1)2 is then computed and rounded to the nearest integer. If the result is equal to k, he scores k points; otherwise he scores nothing.
For example, if k&#8201;=&#8201;6, a&#8201;=&#8201;0.2 and b&#8201;=&#8201;0.85, then (k&#183;a+1)2&#8201;+&#8201;(k&#183;b+1)2&#8201;=&#8201;42.05.
The square root of 42.05 is 6.484... and when rounded to the nearest integer, it becomes 6.
This is equal to k, so he scores 6 points.
It can be shown that if he plays 10 turns with k&#8201;=&#8201;1, k&#8201;=&#8201;2, ..., k&#8201;=&#8201;10, the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places, is 10.20914.
If he plays 105 turns with k&#8201;=&#8201;1, k&#8201;=&#8201;2, k&#8201;=&#8201;3, ..., k&#8201;=&#8201;105, what is the expected value of his total score, rounded to five decimal places?
