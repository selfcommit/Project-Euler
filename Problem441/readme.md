
For an integer M, we define R(M) as the sum of 1/(p&#183;q) for all the integer pairs p and q which satisfy all of these conditions:


 1 &#8804; p < q &#8804; M
 p + q &#8805; M
 p and q are coprime.


We also define S(N) as the sum of R(i) for 2 &#8804; i &#8804; N.
We can verify that S(2) = R(2) = 1/2, S(10) &#8776; 6.9147 and S(100) &#8776; 58.2962.


Find S(107). Give your answer rounded to four decimal places.
