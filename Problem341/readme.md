The Golomb's self-describing sequence {G(n)} is the only nondecreasing sequence of natural numbers such that n appears exactly G(n) times in the sequence. The values of G(n) for the first few n are


n123456789101112131415&#8230;
G(n)122334445556666&#8230;
You are given that G(103) = 86, G(106) = 6137.
You are also given that &#931;G(n3) = 153506976 for 1 &#8804; n < 103.
Find &#931;G(n3) for 1 &#8804; n < 106.
