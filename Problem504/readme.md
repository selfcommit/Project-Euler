Let ABCD be a quadrilateral whose vertices are lattice points lying on the coordinate axes as follows:
A(a, 0), B(0, b), C(&#8722;c, 0), D(0, &#8722;d), where 1 &#8804; a, b, c, d &#8804; m and a, b, c, d, m are integers.
It can be shown that for m = 4 there are exactly 256 valid ways to construct ABCD. Of these 256 quadrilaterals, 42 of them strictly contain a square number of lattice points.
How many quadrilaterals ABCD strictly contain a square number of lattice points for m = 100?
