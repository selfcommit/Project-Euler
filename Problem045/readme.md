Triangle, pentagonal, and hexagonal numbers are generated by the following formulae:


Triangle
&#160;
Tn=n(n+1)/2
&#160;
1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...


Pentagonal
&#160;
Pn=n(3n&#8722;1)/2
&#160;
1, 5, 12, 22, 35, ...


Hexagonal
&#160;
Hn=n(2n&#8722;1)
&#160;
1, 6, 15, 28, 45, ...


It can be verified that T285 = P165 = H143 = 40755.
Find the next triangle number that is also pentagonal and hexagonal.
