Let W(n,k) be the number of ways in which n can be written as the product of k distinct positive integers.
For example, W(144,4) = 7. There are 7 ways in which 144 can be written as a product of 4 distinct positive integers:

144 = 1&#215;2&#215;4&#215;18
144 = 1&#215;2&#215;8&#215;9
144 = 1&#215;2&#215;3&#215;24
144 = 1&#215;2&#215;6&#215;12
144 = 1&#215;3&#215;4&#215;12
144 = 1&#215;3&#215;6&#215;8
144 = 2&#215;3&#215;4&#215;6

Note that permutations of the integers themselves are not considered distinct.
Furthermore, W(100!,10) modulo 1&#160;000&#160;000&#160;007 = 287549200.
Find W(10000!,30) modulo 1&#160;000&#160;000&#160;007.
