Let's call an integer sided triangle with exactly one angle of 60 degrees a 60-degree triangle.
Let r be the radius of the inscribed circle of such a 60-degree triangle.
There are 1234 60-degree triangles for which r &#8804; 100.
Let T(n) be the number of 60-degree triangles for which r &#8804; n, so
 T(100) = 1234,&#160; T(1000) = 22767, and&#160; T(10000) = 359912.
Find T(1053779).
