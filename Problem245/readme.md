We shall call a fraction that cannot be cancelled down a resilient fraction. Furthermore we shall define the resilience of a denominator, R(d), to be the ratio of its proper fractions that are resilient; for example, R(12) = 4&#8260;11.


The resilience of a number d > 1 is then
&#966;(d)d &#8722; 1
, where &#966; is Euler's totient function.




We further define the coresilience of a number n > 1 as C(n)=&#160;
n &#8722; &#966;(n)
n &#8722; 1.


The coresilience of a prime p is C(p)
=&#160;
1p &#8722; 1.


Find the sum of all composite integers 1 < n &#8804; 2&#215;1011, for which C(n) is a unit fraction.
