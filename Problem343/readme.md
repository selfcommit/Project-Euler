For any positive integer k, a finite sequence ai of fractions xi/yi is defined by:
a1 = 1/k and
ai = (xi-1+1)/(yi-1-1) reduced to lowest terms for i>1.
When ai reaches some integer n, the sequence stops. (That is, when yi=1.)
Define f(k) = n. 
For example, for k = 20:


1/20 &#8594; 2/19 &#8594; 3/18 = 1/6 &#8594; 2/5 &#8594; 3/4 &#8594; 4/3 &#8594; 5/2 &#8594; 6/1 = 6


So f(20) = 6.


Also f(1) = 1, f(2) = 2, f(3) = 1 and &#931;f(k3) = 118937 for 1 &#8804; k &#8804; 100.


Find &#931;f(k3) for 1 &#8804; k &#8804; 2&#215;106.
