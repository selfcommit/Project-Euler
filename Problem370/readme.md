Let us define a geometric triangle as an integer sided triangle with sides a &#8804; b &#8804; c so that its sides form a geometric progression, i.e. b2&#160;=&#160;a&#160;&#183;&#160;c&#160;.&#160;
An example of such a geometric triangle is the triangle with sides a = 144, b = 156 and c = 169.
There are 861805 geometric triangles with perimeter &#8804; 106 .
How many geometric triangles exist with perimeter &#8804; 2.5&#183;1013 ?
