Let Sn be the regular n-sided polygon &#8211; or shape &#8211; whose vertices 

vk (k&#8201;=&#8201;1,2,&#8230;,n) have coordinates:



xk&#160;&#8201;&#160;= &#8201;
        cos( 2k-1/n &#215;180&#176;&#8201;)


yk&#160;&#8201;&#160;= &#160;
        sin( 2k-1/n &#215;180&#176;&#8201;)


Each Sn is to be interpreted as a filled shape consisting of all points on the perimeter and in the interior.
The Minkowski sum, S+T, of two shapes S and T is the result of 

adding every point in S to every point in T, where point addition is performed coordinate-wise: 

(u,&#8201;v) + (x,&#8201;y) = (u+x,&#8201;v+y).
For example, the sum of S3 and S4 is the six-sided shape shown in pink below:


How many sides does S1864&#8201;+&#8201;S1865&#8201;+&#8201;&#8230;&#8201;+&#8201;S1909 have?
