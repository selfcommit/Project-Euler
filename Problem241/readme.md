For a positive integer n, let &#963;(n) be the sum of all divisors of n, so e.g. &#963;(6) = 1 + 2 + 3 + 6 = 12.

A perfect number, as you probably know, is a number with &#963;(n) = 2n.


Let us define the perfection quotient of a positive integer asp(n)=&#160;
&#963;(n)n
.


Find the sum of all positive integers n &#8804; 1018 for which p(n) has the form k + 1&#8260;2, where k is an integer.
