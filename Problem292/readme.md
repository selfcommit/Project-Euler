We shall define a pythagorean polygon  to be a convex polygon with the following properties:

there are at least three vertices,
no three vertices are aligned,
each vertex has integer coordinates,
each edge has integer length.
For a given integer n, define P(n) as the number of distinct pythagorean polygons for which the perimeter is &#8804;&#8201;n.
Pythagorean polygons should be considered distinct as long as none is a translation of another.
You are given that P(4)&#8201;=&#8201;1, P(30)&#8201;=&#8201;3655 and P(60)&#8201;=&#8201;891045.
Find P(120).
