
Consider the number 50.
502 = 2500 = 22 &#215; 54, so &#966;(2500) = 2 &#215; 4 &#215; 53 = 8 &#215; 53 = 23 &#215; 53. 1
So 2500 is a square and  &#966;(2500) is a cube.


Find the sum of all numbers n, 1 < n < 1010 such that &#966;(n2) is a cube.


1 &#966; denotes Euler's totient function.
