
Two positive numbers A and B are said to be connected (denoted by "A &#8596; B") if one of these conditions holds:
(1) A and B have the same length and differ in exactly one digit; for example, 123 &#8596; 173.
(2) Adding one digit to the left of A (or B) makes B (or A); for example, 23 &#8596; 223 and 123 &#8596; 23.


We call a prime P a 2's relative if there exists a chain of connected primes between 2 and P and no prime in the chain exceeds P.


For example, 127 is a 2's relative. One of the possible chains is shown below:
2 &#8596; 3 &#8596; 13 &#8596; 113 &#8596; 103 &#8596; 107 &#8596; 127
However, 11 and 103 are not 2's relatives.


Let F(N) be the sum of the primes &#8804; N which are not 2's relatives.
We can verify that F(103) = 431 and F(104) = 78728.


Find F(107).
