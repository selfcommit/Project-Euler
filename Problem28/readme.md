Starting with the number 1 and moving to the right in a clockwise direction a 5 by 5 spiral is formed as follows:
21 22 23 24 25
20 &#160;7 &#160;8 &#160;9 10
19 &#160;6 &#160;1 &#160;2 11
18 &#160;5 &#160;4 &#160;3 12
17 16 15 14 13
It can be verified that the sum of the numbers on the diagonals is 101.
What is the sum of the numbers on the diagonals in a 1001 by 1001 spiral formed in the same way?
