A unit fraction contains 1 in the numerator. The decimal representation of the unit fractions with denominators 2 to 10 are given:



1/2=&#160;0.5


1/3=&#160;0.(3)


1/4=&#160;0.25


1/5=&#160;0.2


1/6=&#160;0.1(6)


1/7=&#160;0.(142857)


1/8=&#160;0.125


1/9=&#160;0.(1)


1/10=&#160;0.1



Where 0.1(6) means 0.166666..., and has a 1-digit recurring cycle. It can be seen that 1/7 has a 6-digit recurring cycle.

Unit fractions whose denominator has no other prime factors than 2 and/or 5 are not considered to have a recurring cycle.
We define the length of the recurring cycle of those unit fractions as 0. 


Let L(n) denote the length of the recurring cycle of 1/n.
You are given that &#8721;L(n) for 3 &#8804; n &#8804; 1 000 000 equals 55535191115.


Find &#8721;L(n) for 3 &#8804; n &#8804; 100 000 000
