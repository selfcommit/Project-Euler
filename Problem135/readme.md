Given the positive integers, x, y, and z, are consecutive terms of an arithmetic progression, the least value of the positive integer, n, for which the equation, x2 &#8722; y2 &#8722; z2 = n, has exactly two solutions is n = 27:
342 &#8722; 272 &#8722; 202 = 122 &#8722; 92 &#8722; 62 = 27
It turns out that n = 1155 is the least value which has exactly ten solutions.
How many values of n less than one million have exactly ten distinct solutions?
