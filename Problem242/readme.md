Given the set {1,2,...,n}, we define f(n,k) as the number of its k-element subsets with an odd sum of elements. For example, f(5,3)&#8201;=&#8201;4, since the set {1,2,3,4,5} has four 3-element subsets having an odd sum of elements, i.e.: {1,2,4}, {1,3,5}, {2,3,4} and {2,4,5}.
When all three values n, k and f(n,k) are odd, we say that they make 
an odd-triplet [n,k,f(n,k)].
There are exactly five odd-triplets with n&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;10, namely:
[1,1,f(1,1)&#8201;=&#8201;1], [5,1,f(5,1)&#8201;=&#8201;3], [5,5,f(5,5)&#8201;=&#8201;1], [9,1,f(9,1)&#8201;=&#8201;5] and [9,9,f(9,9)&#8201;=&#8201;1].
How many odd-triplets are there with n&#8201;&#8804;&#8201;1012&#8201;?
