
For an n-tuple of integers t = (a1, ..., an), let (x1, ..., xn) be the solutions of the polynomial equation xn + a1xn-1 + a2xn-2 + ... + an-1x + an = 0.


Consider the following two conditions:

x1, ..., xn are all real.
If x1, ..., xn are sorted, &#8970;xi&#8971; = i for 1 &#8804; i &#8804; n. (&#8970;&#183;&#8971;: floor function.)



In the case of n = 4, there are 12 n-tuples of integers which satisfy both conditions.
We define S(t) as the sum of the absolute values of the integers in t.
For n = 4 we can verify that &#8721;S(t) = 2087 for all n-tuples t which satisfy both conditions.


Find &#8721;S(t) for n = 7.
