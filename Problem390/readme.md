Consider the triangle with sides &#8730;5, &#8730;65 and &#8730;68.
It can be shown that this triangle has area 9.
S(n) is the sum of the areas of  all triangles with sides &#8730;(1+b2), &#8730;(1+c2) and &#8730;(b2+c2) (for positive integers b and c ) that have an integral area not exceeding n.
The example triangle has b=2 and c=8.
S(106)=18018206.
Find S(1010).
