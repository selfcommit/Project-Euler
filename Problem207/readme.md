For some positive integers k, there exists an integer partition of the form&#160;&#160; 4t = 2t + k,
where 4t, 2t, and k are all positive integers and t is a real number.
The first two such partitions are 41 = 21 + 2 and 41.5849625... = 21.5849625... + 6.
Partitions where t is also an integer are called perfect. 
For any m &#8805; 1 let P(m) be the proportion of such partitions that are perfect with k &#8804; m.
Thus P(6) = 1/2.
In the following table are listed some values of P(m)
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(5) = 1/1
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(10) = 1/2
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(15) = 2/3
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(20) = 1/2
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(25) = 1/2
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(30) = 2/5
&#160;&#160;&#160;...
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(180) = 1/4
&#160;&#160;&#160;P(185) = 3/13
Find the smallest m for which P(m) < 1/12345
