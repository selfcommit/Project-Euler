In England the currency is made up of pound, &#163;, and pence, p, and there are eight coins in general circulation:
1p, 2p, 5p, 10p, 20p, 50p, &#163;1 (100p) and &#163;2 (200p).
It is possible to make &#163;2 in the following way:
1&#215;&#163;1 + 1&#215;50p + 2&#215;20p + 1&#215;5p + 1&#215;2p + 3&#215;1p
How many different ways can &#163;2 be made using any number of coins?
