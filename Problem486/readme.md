Let F5(n) be the number of strings s such that:

s consists only of '0's and '1's,
s has length at most n, and
s contains a palindromic substring of length at least 5.

For example, F5(4)&#160;=&#160;0, F5(5)&#160;=&#160;8, 
F5(6)&#160;=&#160;42 and F5(11)&#160;=&#160;3844.
Let D(L) be the number of integers n such that 
5&#160;&#8804;&#160;n&#160;&#8804;&#160;L and F5(n) is divisible by 87654321.
For example, D(107)&#160;=&#160;0 and D(5&#183;109)&#160;=&#160;51.
Find D(1018).
