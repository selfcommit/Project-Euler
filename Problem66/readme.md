Consider quadratic Diophantine equations of the form:
x2 &#8211; Dy2 = 1
For example, when D=13, the minimal solution in x is 6492 &#8211; 13&#215;1802 = 1.
It can be assumed that there are no solutions in positive integers when D is square.
By finding minimal solutions in x for D = {2, 3, 5, 6, 7}, we obtain the following:
32 &#8211; 2&#215;22 = 1
22 &#8211; 3&#215;12 = 1
92 &#8211; 5&#215;42 = 1
52 &#8211; 6&#215;22 = 1
82 &#8211; 7&#215;32 = 1
Hence, by considering minimal solutions in x for D &#8804; 7, the largest x is obtained when D=5.
Find the value of D &#8804; 1000 in minimal solutions of x for which the largest value of x is obtained.
